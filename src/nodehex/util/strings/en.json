    "p1": "Given the ever-growing scope of information management and its application in leveraging data for increased value to Design, Construction, Commissioning and Owner teams, it’s imperative to identify and more importantly, improve on data collection for operations and maintenance manuals. During a hyperscale datacenter build, the sheer amount of information produced can be staggering and finding effective ways to manage the data into handover - especially when modern hyperscale datacenter handover packages often consist of up to 50,000 documents or more - can be a challenge.",
    "p2": "Coordinating and staggering this information across a project takes a knowledge of the phasing for a hyperscale datacenter and ancillary buildings, such as substations and utility buildings, a deep understanding of the information lifecycle the integration of quality and project management best practices at the right times to ensure an optimal outcome.",

    "p1": "While the project controls teams often excel at managing cost, commercials and schedule, and there is often some analytics focused on BIM, Quality and Documentation, the full potential of these services are never actually realised. Often projects have a bulky and manual extract, transfer and load process that doesn’t offer flexibility and real-time reporting due to tool restraints, technical restraints and general lack of expertise in data science and implementation.",
