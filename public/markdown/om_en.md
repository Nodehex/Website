# Core information management services

Our services focus on digital construction delivery throughout the entire lifecycle of a project, broken down into three core competencies, project initialisation, reporting and handover services.

----------

# Project Initialisation Services

Handover is often left as a final checkbox once the final phases of construction and commissioning are nearing their completion, rather than front-loaded effort that kicks off at design. A majority of the issues during handover can often be mitigated by an experienced information management team developing the correct plans, processes and procedures, which then enables a progressive handover, rather than a massive end of project task.

Our team has experience authoring, reviewing, approving and implementing document management across largescale projects. We understand client needs, your requirements and translate them into effective processes and procedures for the execution of the project. To do this we:

-   Fully authored Document Management Plan inclusive of client requirements and coordination of the review and approval process.
-   Breakdown and detailing of core system set up and requirements, workflows, management requirements and handover processes within the plan.
-   Provide visual workflows to convey the project processes concisely.

# Master Deliverable Index, Handover Index and Handover coordination

![Master Deliverable Workflow](https://nodehex.com/assets/flowcharts/IM_WF_3.svg)

Understanding delivery of information is core to holding vendors, suppliers and subcontractors accountable for handover. Getting these processes in place and executed during the early phases of the project guarantees a low-effort handover and visible accountability.

To mitigate late delivery and overdue handover risk we:

-   Initiate the  Master Deliverable Index  (MDI) and  Handover indexes  (HOI) and develop them continually as parallel actions from the outset of the project.
-   Coordinate with the subcontractors to populate and develop the MDI to ensure full visibility and understanding across the board.
-   Integrate with the commissioning teams to project and support the commissioning documentation and its handover.
-   Coordinating the handover, including tracking of all PDF and native deliverables across numerous systems and into the client's repositories.
